                In this year of mission 2022,
                I think the Idea of sharing your goals publicly is great. Writing down your goals make you think about
                them and holds you more accountable.

                Let’s share and contribute to each other’s personal goals too!

                My goals are to is this year 2022:

                Become a better ReactJS developer
                Become CTO of a booming company, soon!
                Setup a dashing developer desk

                I personally have just one goal I want to achieve. Writing one piece of code that I come back to years
                later, and to think "cool, not too shabby".

                To reach there, I have to code and learn and code and every iteration I become a little better. That's
                the problem with reaching a certain level, it's not that easy to improve anymore.

                    <li>Minimum Protection: Masks (KN95 or N95 only. Cloth masks offer no protection against Omicron,
                        and surgical masks only help a little. KN95 masks seal against your face and filter 95% of
                        particles, including viruses. They aren’t perfect protection but are the best available. Mask
                        effectiveness studies here. Available on Amazon.</li>
                    <li>
                        Vaccinations: Two shot vaccinations are ineffective against Omicron. You need to have the
                        booster shot as well. Even then, you rely on staying in safe environments and wearing a mask as
                        your primary defense. Your vaccination won’t stop you from getting infected; its job is to keep
                        you from becoming seriously ill and going to the hospital.

                        Monoclonal Antibody Treatments: One of the most effective tools against severe illness with
                        Covid has been monoclonal antibody treatments. This treatment should be done very early in the
                        disease process to prevent the infection from becoming more serious. It’s been discovered that
                        of the three monoclonal antibody treatments available, only one works with Omicron.
